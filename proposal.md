# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Excalibur 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A software that combines and automates, and allows control other spftware

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software will be a multi platform virtual assistant. Within the software I will have access to project and time managment software, connect to siri and other apple services, and commnicate with chat gpt. It's main features would be the ability to project and time manage as well as keep me updated with my schedule and other important dates. It'll excute by taking advantage of these already made software and connecting their data into one app. In theory the software I'm creating would more create a spider web of software acting as a virtual assistant. 


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable 

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

 A good out come for my project would be a software that is able to help me project manage effiecntly and use chat gpt to its fullest potential. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better out come would be the previsouly mentioned features along with being connected to Siri(and maybe other important iphone functions) and allow for time managment as well. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The previosuly mentioned feauteres as well as being cross platform and certain display features so I can accuratly understand any time data and project data 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next steps include first finalzing the structure of the program and figuring out which as aspects of my software are already created and which aspects I need to create. The next step is understanding what model I'd need to do in order to make a software able to accses different softwares. The most important thing I need to learn is how to make a program with the ability to handle this many different functions.
